# Rust-Resources
**1. The Rust Book** - https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ This should be the first thing. Just go through the entire book. It will give you excellent foundations.

**2. Rust By Example** - https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/ Similar to Solidity By Example, a great resource to see how are different concepts used in the real world

**3. Tour Of Rust** - https://tourofrust.com/ More examples

**4. Jon Gjegset - Crust Of Rust** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAl-9HwD858&list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa This is one of the best resources for Rust online. Jon is an experienced Rust developer, and in this series, he explains concepts like Lifetime annotations, Dynamic vs. Static dispatch, and much more. But you already have to know the language since it is more of an intermediate tutorial. So before jumping in, I recommend you finish The Rust Book

**5. Jon Gjegset - Rust For Rustaceans** - https://nostarch.com/rust-rustaceans By the same author as the last resource, it costs 40 euros, but in my opinion worth every penny. It also expects you to have previous knowledge of Rust, so don’t start reading until you finish The Rust Book.

**6. Ryan Levick** - https://www.youtube.com/@RyanLevicksVideos Microsoft developer that has a few videos about rust

**7. Rustlings** - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings Small Rust exercises, a pretty good resource

**8. Exercism Rust Track** - https://exercism.org/tracks/rust I haven’t used this one but heard many good things about it.

**9. Advent Of Code Solutions by Timvisee** - https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2021 To even understand these solutions, you have to know how iterators work in Rust. It is a lot of work to go through the solutions, but it is definitely worth it.

**10. HackerRank Challenges** - https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard lot of the challenges have the option to solve them in rust.

**11. Rust Quiz by DTolnay** - https://dtolnay.github.io/rust-quiz/26 David Tolnay is one of the best and biggest open-source contributors to the Rust ecosystem. He is the author of crates like Serde, Anyhow, ThisError, and much more. These crates are used in almost every rust project. The quiz is extremely hard, but it is worth checking it out.

**12. EVM implementation in Rust**  - https://github.com/bluealloy/revm If you already know how the EVM is implemented in Go, it will be a lot easier to understand.

**13. The Rustnomicon** - https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ Very advanced book about unsafe rust. It is not necessary to know the techniques they use in this book since it is very low-level, but if you have some spare time, it is a pretty interesting read.

**14. The Rust Reference** - https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/ Informal explanation of the language. If you wanted to build a new compiler for Rust, you would use this book to understand how things work.

**15. Learning Rust With Too Many Linked Lists** - https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/ Linked lists in Rust are much harder to build than in other languages. It is mostly because of the memory model, you can’t have a list that is of unknown size. So we have to use smart pointers like Box to get around that. This resource is a bit outdated, but a lot of the concepts are still true.

**16. Rust API Guidelines** - https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines A must read when writing a rust code.
